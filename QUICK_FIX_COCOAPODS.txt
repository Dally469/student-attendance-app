QUICK FIX FOR COCOAPODS DETECTION
==================================

Your CocoaPods is installed, but Flutter can't find it. Here's the quickest fix:

OPTION 1: Create Symlink (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------
Run this in Terminal (you'll need to enter your password):

sudo ln -sf ~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.3.4/bin/pod /usr/local/bin/pod

Then verify:
which pod
pod --version

OPTION 2: Add RVM to PATH (Permanent Fix)
------------------------------------------
Run this in Terminal:

echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.3.4/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

Then restart your IDE.

OPTION 3: Install CocoaPods via Homebrew
-----------------------------------------
If you have Homebrew:

brew install cocoapods

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ CocoaPods is installed (1.16.2)
✅ Pods are installed in ios/Pods
✅ All code errors fixed
✅ Firebase Storage patches applied

The only issue is Flutter can't detect CocoaPods in PATH.

AFTER FIXING:
1. Restart your IDE
2. Try running the app again
3. It should work!
