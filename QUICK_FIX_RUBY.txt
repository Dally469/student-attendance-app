QUICK FIX FOR "CocoaPods is installed but broken" ERROR
=================================================================

THE PROBLEM:
Flutter can see CocoaPods but says it's "broken" because there's a
Ruby version mismatch between where CocoaPods is installed (RVM Ruby)
and what Flutter/IDE is using (System Ruby).

THE SOLUTION:
Install CocoaPods for the System Ruby that Flutter uses.

=================================================================
QUICK FIX (Run in Terminal):
=================================================================

cd /Users/rigobert/Documents/flutter/student-attendance-app
./FIX_COCOAPODS_NOW.sh

OR manually:

sudo gem install cocoapods

=================================================================
AFTER RUNNING:
=================================================================

1. Restart your IDE completely (quit and reopen)
2. Try running your Flutter app again
3. It should work!

=================================================================
WHY THIS WORKS:
=================================================================

- CocoaPods is currently installed with RVM Ruby 3.3.4
- Flutter/IDE uses System Ruby 2.6.10
- Installing CocoaPods for System Ruby ensures Flutter can use it
- Both installations can coexist - no conflicts!

=================================================================
VERIFICATION:
=================================================================

After installing, verify:
  /usr/bin/ruby -S pod --version

Should show: 1.16.2 (or similar)

=================================================================
CURRENT STATUS:
=================================================================

✅ CocoaPods installed (1.16.2) with RVM Ruby
✅ Pods are installed in ios/Pods  
✅ All code errors fixed
✅ Firebase Storage patches applied
⚠️ Just need CocoaPods for System Ruby
